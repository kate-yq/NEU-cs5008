Introduction to C
1. declare verible:
    type, size, name
2. initialization:
    assign a value to a veriable for the first time
3. scanf() - an input method, == input() in Python
    scanf("%d", &i); & means get the memory address of i
4. char can be 'x' or '45' 
5. const == final in Java

*********************************************
6. address in memory is called pointer
7. pointer is a C data type
    declare pointer:   int* y = &x;
    add the *
    &x --> get the address of x
    y will have the value of x, but if x change, y will also change
    in other words, the value of y is x


8. library

9. structs (structures)
    == class in Java
    typedef struct Student{
        int age;
        int id;
        char campus;
    } Student_type;
    Student_type s1; // declare a veriable of type Student


10. stacks - LIFO
